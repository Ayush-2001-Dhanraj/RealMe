    <h1 class="subHeading">About Me</h1>
    <p class="x">
      This is Ayush Dhanraj and I am 19 years old college going CSE student.
      Currently trying to find out my originality. I am a kind of crazy but
      this is actually the kinky thing that makes me different among a group
      of stupid over smart people who often get out-smarted. I don't talk shit
      unless it is true and that is the reason why I have a very few friends.
      I don't live people circumsizing my circumstance I only do my own dance.
      This is not just a regular website of mine, it is personal in true sense
      as throughout this website I am actually trying to say out all that I
      ever wanted say, so if you are a kind of a person that is steriotypical
      in nature then this is the wrong place for you and you can check my
      "good boy" <a href="https://ayush-2001-dhanraj.github.io/Ayush/">personal website</a> that I have created. So if
      you are still here then lets go head.😁

    <h1 class="subHeading">My personality</h1>
    <p class="x">
      As I have already mentioned, I am pretty straight forward in term of my
      views but when it comes to sharing my views among people I love or I
      know I mostly hesitate a lot out of no reason. I am somewhat
      unpredictable because I have gone through so many incidents where I did
      some unexpectable things that I could never image me doing but there are
      also certain incidents where I hesitated unnecessarily like once I
      hesitated in thankyou to one of my teachers for helping (I know I am
      sick!! 🙄). I also have a very bad habbit of taking revenge as I never
      forget anything bad that happened with me.
      <br><br><strong>for example: </strong>In my third semester, I had
      Data Structure as my core subject with a highly stupid, over-smart (I
      hate over smart people) and boring faculty for the subject who always
      had a missconception about him being the biggest DS teacher who knows
      everything (truth: can't even write a simple code of linked list
      correctly in one go but still !!). He had a youtube channel where he
      used to upload DS related videos (relly irrelavent and monotonous) and
      he used to teach only half part in the class and then casually tell us
      to do the rest part from his video (what a plan 😭). After that semester
      ended I immediately un-subscribed to his channel and then through my
      another Gmail ID, I wrote whatever I had in my heart throughout the
      semester for him (I went really too mean 😎 and nasty 🤬). It created a
      huge buzz because it was the first time a faculty member was said all
      that and every one was trying to search for the person who did that (I
      was also given the task to find him 😁🤣🤣). I felt really relaxed after
      that, but it would have been more relaxing if I would have said that to
      his face but he is a prof. and I had to stay over their for next 5 sems
      also so I just satisfied myself with the same only. Haha!!

    <h1 class="subHeading">bigger than life</h1>
    <p class="x">
      My ambition in life is to be a better person who is not too hesitant in doing anything and is a free soul (as I always wanted to be). I want to see myself
      as person is the controller of its own life (currently also I have control over my life but still😎), I want to wear clothes of my wish do
      my makeup of my choice, in short do whatever I ever thought of doing in my dreams. <br>
      For my carrier point of view I am quite facinated towards web development and the world on the web so I want to be a full fledged web
      developer and create a lot of website and then I also have a startup plan, so I want to see myself starting my very own startup in future.

      I have always been a person who hesitates a lot and this is one of the reason i kinda lost my original self. This mainly happend once
      I changed my school to much popular and prestigeous school which ultimately changed me, earlier I was kind of a free soul who was cheerfull
      and full with happiness. In this new environment I changed completely, I started thinking more about how people wil judge me and the most
      common thing "What will the SOCIETY think of me??".<br>But since I entered into college I started realizing the fact that I must do what
      I always wanted to do and share whatever I felt so surely this is a turning point in my life.<br>
      I started believing in me and this ultimately helped me in realizing my orientation (I hope you might guess it from the pictures over here. 😏).
      I now believe that love is love and no one has a fu*king right to define it on their own thinking 🥰.
